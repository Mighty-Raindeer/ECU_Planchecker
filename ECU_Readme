*** This file is a fork from RexCarden's planchecker

The goal of this plan checker is to cater the capabilities of Rex Carden's design for ECU's clinic. 

To do:
Fix font colors, some drop down fonts are too light against the background.
Provide logos in the report
Fix bug where system freezes if QA course is selected for plan check, either make QA courses un checkable or find exemption
make updateable templates, provide templates from ECU for specific doctors, doctor search of patient should work
collision check included in report
confirm collision check is accpetable for truebeam
filter out some warnings that do not apply to ECU's clinic
change some language of reports to better suit clinical needs
have fun
